My name is Mike Blaszczak. I'm mostly retired now, but I'm a software engineer who's worked at Microsoft, Valve, Amazon, and Oracle.

The projects here aren't particularly professional--they're my hobby projects. I've been writing some utilities to help with ham radio and do some work with the Wikipedia corpus. My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems are here, too. I've also been fooling around with an implementation of the SQL language, which has been a lot of fun.
